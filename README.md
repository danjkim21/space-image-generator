## About Space Image Generator

This project generates a new background image from NASA's popular [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and provides a brief description of the image. The goal was to make a simple yet elegent web application that made navigating the APOD API a smooth and perhaps calming experience.
