## About Calm. Space Generator

Space. It's pretty darn cool! As a city kid, there have only been a handful of times where I got the chance to look up and say, "Now **that** is pretty darn cool!" There's a certain sense of bittersweet-ness, knowing that you'll never really be able to capture that calming pause in time and imagery without being some sort of master photography whiz. 

This project generates a new background image from NASA's popular [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API](https://api.nasa.gov/) each day, and provides a brief description of the image. The goal was to make a simple yet elegent web application that provides a smooth and maybe even calming experience.

## How It's Made
